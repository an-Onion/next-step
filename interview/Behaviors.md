# Behaviors

## Tell me about how you worked effectively under pressure

I had been working on a mobile app which was previously  in the charge of JP side. Of course, I've know nothing about this code and even don't know their comment of JP. My supervisor came to me and said that we needed to fix their task in iteration, while keeping our own projects on time.

Then I asked our designers for help, and fully understood the business. Then I wrote the document for 2-days, after that, I assigned sub-tasks according to the Diagram in the document. All my people felt it easy to reach their goals, then effectively finished the task in time. Of course, I had a great group of people to work with, but I think that under great pressure, we still need to follow the Software Engineering Standard workflow. Never too late to do system design.

## How do you handle a challenge

In most cases, challenge means opportunity. One time, we need to get rid of the previous architecture due to too-high cost, and set up a environment in Amazon Cloud. Nobody knows the new environment, but I had heard the technique stacks of AWS before. So I spent a week to prepared a Technique Design Review. It's a successful review It and my supervisor agreed with my proposal.  Then our department start to  refactor the legacy code, and finally reduce the cost by 90%. Study everyday, and seize it when challenge comes.

## Have you ever made a mistake

I once merged some code into the production environment without tests, and then some pages can not be open then, but My manager need to show the new features to the customers in the next morning. Later, I went to the office very very early and fix the bug in time. Though my manger did not criticize me, I still feel guilt about this, and learned to pay close attention to tests. in any term we need to follow workflow.

## Give an example of how you set goals

Within a few weeks of beginning my first job as a sales associate in a department store, I knew that I wanted to be in the fashion industry. I decided that I would work my way up to department manager, and at that point I would have enough money saved to be able to attend design school full-time. I did just that, and I even landed my first job through an internship I completed the summer before graduation.
