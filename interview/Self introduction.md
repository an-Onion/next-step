## Self introduction

Hello,

My name is Cong Ma, and I've been passionate about web development for over nine years. Let me take you through my journey.

Education:
I started my academic journey at Xi'an University of Electronic Science and Technology, where I earned a Bachelor of Software Engineering degree in July 2012. I then pursued further studies and obtained my Master of Computer Science from Zhejiang University in April 2015.

Early Career:
Right after my master's, I joined Works Applications as a Senior Expert in April 2015. For the first four years, I was at the forefront of developing an HR Recruitment SaaS application tailored for Japanese companies. It was an exciting project where I initiated the project, designed the business architecture, and even mentored new team members.

In 2020, I took on a challenging project to refactor HUE Drive, a cloud file storage product. We successfully decomposed the monolithic system into microservices and migrated to AWS services, which resulted in a significant 90% cost reduction. My role involved rewriting the front-end in TypeScript & React.js and synchronizing data across cloud vendors.

Coupang:
In October 2021, I moved to Coupang as a Senior Front End Developer. Initially, I was responsible for the supplier portal in South Korea and Taiwan, which included managing over 50 downstream services. I led the implementation of an i18n real-time translation platform, developed premium data reports, and introduced a self-service coupon service using tRPC. A significant achievement was refactoring our downstream web pages into a micro frontend system.

From 2023 to 2024, my focus shifted to the Selection Intelligent Platform, aiming to streamline Coupang's product selection process. I designed and constructed the web application using Next.js, led the front-end development, and built a UI component library from scratch using shadcn/ui.

Current Role:
Currently, as the Front-end Tech Lead at Coupang, I continue to drive innovation and efficiency in our front-end projects, maintaining a strong focus on full-stack JavaScript applications and UI component development.

Patents:
Along the way, I've been fortunate to contribute to two patented solutions: an SSO Dynamic theme solution and an automatic translation platform design.
