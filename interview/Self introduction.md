## Self introduction

Hello,

My name is Cong Ma, and I've been passionate about web development for over nine years. Let me take you through my journey.

Education:
I started my academic journey at Xi'an University of Electronic Science and Technology, where I earned a Bachelor of Software Engineering degree in July 2012. I then pursued further studies and obtained my Master of Computer Science from Zhejiang University in April 2015.

Early Career:
Right after my master's, I joined a Japanese Company, Works Applications as a software engineer. For the first four years, I was at the forefront of developing an HR Recruitment SaaS application tailored\[teɪləd\] for Japanese companies. It was an exciting project where I initiated and designed the business architecture.

In 2020, I took on a challenging project to refactor another SaaS Application HUE Drive, a cloud file storage product. We successfully decomposed a monolithic\[ˌmɒnəˈlɪθɪk\] system into microservices and migrated to AWS, which resulted in a significant 90% cost reduction. My role involved in rewriting the front-end and synchronizing data across different platform.

In October 2021, I moved to Coupang as a Senior Front End Developer. Initially, I was responsible for the supplier-hub in South Korea and Taiwan, which included managing dozens of downstream services. I led the implementation of an i18n real-time translation platform, developed premium data reports, and introduced a vendor self-service coupon application. A significant achievement was refactoring our downstream web pages into a micro frontend system.

Since last year, my focus shifted to the Selection Intelligent Platform, aiming to streamline Coupang's product selection process. I designed and constructed the web application using new technologies, led the front-end development, and built a UI component library from scratch.

Currently, as the Front-end Tech Lead at Coupang, I continue to drive innovation and efficiency in our front-end projects, maintaining a strong focus on full-stack JavaScript applications and UI component development.


This is my nine year's working experience. Thanks for taking the time.

Best regards,
Cong Ma
