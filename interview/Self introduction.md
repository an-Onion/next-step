## Self introduction

Hello,

My name is Cong Ma, and I've been passionate about web development for around 10 years. Let me take you through my journey.


Early Career:

9 years ago, I got my master degree from Zhejiang University, and soon joined in an ERP Company, Works Applications as a software engineer. In my first job, I was at the forefront of developing an HR Recruitment SaaS application tailored\[teɪləd\] for Japanese companies. It was an exciting project where I initiated and designed wap's first SaaS product from zero. We successfully decomposed a monolithic\[ˌmɒnəˈlɪθɪk\] system into microservices and migrated to AWS lambda functions, which resulted in a significant 90% cost reduction.

In October 2021, I moved to Coupang as a Senior Front End Developer. Initially, I was responsible for the supplier-hub in South Korea and Taiwan, which included managing dozens of downstream services. I led the implementation of a real-time translation platform, developed premium data reports, and introduced a vendor self-service coupon application. A significant achievement during this time was refactoring our downstream web pages into a micro frontend system.

From last year, my focus shifted to the Selection Intelligent Platform, aiming to streamline Coupang's product selection process. I designed and constructed the web application using new js technologies, led the front-end development, and built a UI component library from scratch.

Currently, as the Tech Lead at Coupang retail department, I continue to drive innovation and efficiency in our front-end projects, maintaining a strong focus on full-stack JavaScript applications and UI component development.


This is the profile of my nine year's working journey. Thanks for taking the time.

Best regards,
Cong Ma
